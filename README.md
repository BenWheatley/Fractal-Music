# Fractal-Music
Music generator. Written for personal use to create video game audio before I decided to stop making video games.

Second generation composer. I'm intending to upload the first-gen one as a separate project if I can find the source code.

Making the source code public in the hope of it becoming potentially useful. If you're looking at an early commit, don't expect it to be *nice*, it was originally written in 2011, before I understood the virtues of git for single-developer projects.
